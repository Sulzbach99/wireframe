### 3D Object Wireframe Viewer ###

This viewer uses SDL to project any Wavefront OBJ (.obj) file given as input on the screen. The user can spin the object freely with the mouse or the arrows in the keyboard.

This project was a part of the examination of the course "Oficina de Computação" (Computing Workshop) from the second semester of 2017 (2017-2) of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science of the brazilian university "UFPR - Universidade Federal do Paraná".

There were two bonus tasks which I implemented:

* Implementation of a "strong" projection instead of using the weak projection formula given by the professor;
* Listening of mouse input besides keyboard input to spin the model.

A proper description of the project can be found at the course page (in portuguese): http://wiki.inf.ufpr.br/maziero/doku.php?id=prog2:visualizacao_de_modelos_3d
